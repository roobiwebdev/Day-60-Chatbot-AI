#Day60 of #100DaysChallenge

Good Evening Fam,

🚀Today's project has been incredibly exciting I successfully created a chatbot, and it was a rewarding experience to see it working well.

Here’s what I tackled today: 

✅ Implementing the chat interface using HTML and CSS  

✅ Adding JavaScript functionality to handle user messages and bot responses 

✅ Integrating file upload and emoji picker features for a more interactive experience 

✅ Integrating the Google API for generating dynamic bot responses

It was educational exercise, and I'm looking forward to implementing more features in the upcoming days maybe, if u have any idea lemme know.
let's keep pushing forward ⚡️
